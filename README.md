# DE-TS

A large-scale differential evolutionary algorithm based on transdifferentiation strategy for solving the rail-guided vehicle dynamic scheduling problem, which is developed by MLNST (Machine Learning and New Software Technology Institute) of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology.

Thank you for using the DE-TS developed under the auspices of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology. This platform can be used to solve the rail-guided vehicle dynamic scheduling problem (RDSP). Thanks to these developers for their important contributions during the development of this platform.
